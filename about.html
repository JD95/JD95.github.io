            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This page is not so much an explination of what this blog is “about” in so much as it is a means for me to define for myself why I am doing this. Initially I wanted this to be a programming blog where I would share my intersting discoveries or techniques, but then I found myself without much ready to actually write about. As with all sparks of motivation without kindling, the desire to actually write about anything died out after several weeks of not publishing anything. Then, in one of my bouts of self reflection, I realized that I did have something I could begin to immedately share with the world, or rather something that I wanted to share with the world.</p>
<p>Whether it was a quarter life crisis in the face of soon moving into the “real” world or if it was the growing dull acke of nostalgia spawned by years of being in school, I wanted to revist my education. I have always been interested in learning. As a child my mind was my greatest, and at times only, weapon. It makes sense that I would care so much about the learning process, but it was only towards the very end of my “schooling” years that I began to structure my examination of my knowledge.</p>
<p>In my experience, learning happens in three phases. Fist, one is completely illiterate about something. In reading one does not even know what letters are. The second phase is when information is memorized. In math this is when one learns their times tables by route. The final stage is when the raw information is organized and useful patterns emerge. In learning music, this is when the larger forms of a piece become apparent and the compositional choices are made obvious.</p>
<p>What then are the stages of learning how to learn? The form of this process is tricky in that everyone seems to be born with the innate ability. Some appear to the better at it than others, but everyone is at least capable of learning some subjects well. Perhaps a more accurate way to describe the process of learning how to learn is to view it as refinement instead of construction.</p>
<p>Around my junior year of high school I began to entertain the idea that perhaps all the various subjects being taught in school had a relationship to eachother. Until that point I had never considered my education as a whole. Admittedly I bought into the concept that certain people were “math people” or “writing people”. In the fundamental subjects which have been with us since kinderguarden it seemed almost self evident that these subjects be considered seperate. They were always taught seperately and often by different people. However things got fuzzy as the grades go by. Social sciences involve quite a bit of reading and writing. Clearly subjects like chemistry, bioloy, and physics were all releated. I realized the relationship between music and poetry thanks to Mr. Leonard Bernstein’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fHi36dvTdE">“Unanswered Question”</a> lecture series. So are people split along a “writing” and “math” boundry with all of the other subjects branching out of the two?</p>

<p>The above comic raises and interesting view on the various subjects which puts them on a sort of spectrum between math and, if we project past sociology, reading and writing on the other. Mortimer Adler in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book">How to Read a Book</a> describes the fundamentals of reading depending on an understanding of both grammer <em>and</em> logic. This is important given the dependence of mathematics on logic. So perhaps there is a tentative hope for somehow uniting all of human knowledge after all.</p>
<p>The thought process of joining differet subjects has a parallel with the third phase of learning, organization. However there is much to be wanted at this point. So what if one can organize their existing knowledge, it does not necessarily follow that learning new subjects be any easier for it. True as that may be, it does follow that knowing the useful patterns within knowledge makes a subject easier to teach. Teaching and learning are inextricable and perhaps learning itself could be considered self-teaching.</p>
<p>Thus, my goal is to see whether a general learning process can be abstracted by learning with teaching in mind. To do so I am going to attempt to return to the start of my education, revisting the old lessons while commenting on the subjects with my current knowledge. In terms of format, I doubt I will be sticking to a strictly chronological exploration. Contentwise, I doubt this blog will be used exlusively to answer my questions about learning. However, I intend to use the prospect of publishing on a public forum to improve the quality of the content that I produce what ever it may be.</p>
<p>All that being said, I hope there is something in this blog you find either useful or insightful.</p>
