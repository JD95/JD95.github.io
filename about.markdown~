This page is not so much an explination of what this blog is "about" in so much as it is a means for me to define for myself why I am doing this. Initially I wanted this to be a programming blog where I would share my intersting discoveries or techniques, but then I found myself without much ready to actually write about. As with all sparks of motivation without kindling, the desire to actually write about anything died out after several weeks of not publishing anything. Then, in one of my bouts of self reflection, I realized that I did have something I could begin to immedately share with the world, or rather something that I wanted to share with the world.

Whether it was a quater life crisis in the face of soon moving into the "real" world or if it was the growing dull acke of nostalgia spawned by years of being in school, I wanted to revist my education. I have always been interested in learning. As a child my mind was my greatest, and at times only, weapon. It makes sense that I would care so much about the learning process, but it was only towards the very end of my "schooling" years that I began to structure my examination of my knowledge.

In my experience, learning happens in three phases. Fist, one is completely illiterate about something. In reading one does not even know what letters are. The second phase is when information is memorized. In math this is when one learns their times tables by route. The final stage is when the raw information is organized and useful patterns emerge. In learning music, this is when the larger forms of a piece become apparent and the compositional choices are made obvious.

What then are the stages of learning how to learn? The form of this process is tricky in that everyone seems to be born with the innate ability. Some appear to the better at it than others, but everyone is at least capable of learning some subjects well. Perhaps a more accurate way to describe the process of learning how to learn is to view it as refinement instead of construction. 

Around my junior year of high school I began to entertain the idea that perhaps all the various subjects being taught in school had a relationship to eachother. Clearly subjects like chemistry, bioloy, and physics were all releated. I realized the relationship between music and poetry thanks to Mr. Leonard Bernstein's "Unanswered Question" lecture series. Yet the question remained, where there distinct "fields" of human knowledge or could everything be considered as a whole?

The thought process of joining different subjects has a parallel with the third phase of learning, organization. However there is much to be wanted at this point. So what if one can organize their existing knowledge, it does not necessarily follow that learning new subjects be any easier for it. True as that may be, it does follow that knowing the useful patterns within knowledge makes a subject easier to teach. Teaching and learning are inextricable and perhaps learning itself could be considered self-teaching.

Thus, my goal is to see whether a general learning process can be abstracted by learning with teaching in mind. To do so I am going to attempt to return back to the very start of my education and revist all of the old lessons while also making commentary on the subjects with my current knowledge. In terms of format I doubt I'm going to stick to a strictly chronological exploration and in terms of content I doubt this blog will be used exlusively to answer my questions about learning. However, I intend the prospect of publishing on a public forum to improve the quality of the content that I produce.

All that being said, I hope there is something this blog that you find useful or insightful.
