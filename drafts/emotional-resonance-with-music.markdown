Question: Should one listen to happy music when depressed or sad music?

### The Intuitive Answer

One should play music which aligns with their desired emotional state

When one is sad they should listen to happy music to cheer them up

### From Personal Experience

Music can serve as a form of validation

Listen to sad music when you are sad, but don't listen to depressing music

Pay attention to the "message" of the song, don't listen to music where the artist wants to kill themselves or something, just expressing a sense of melancholy.
