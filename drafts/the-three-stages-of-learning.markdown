title: The Three Stages of Learning
---



### Knowing Nothing

At this stage one knows next to nothing about a subject beyond what it is called or maybe even a vague familiarity gleaned through TV, books, or the Internet. Children experience this state much more than adults or even teenagers do. As people grow older they likely have much more lite exposure to unfamiliar concepts and grow to "accept" the feeling as a part of life.


#### Foreign Languages

For example it is unlikely for someone to know English, Chinese, and a Khoisan language at the same time. For someone who knows only one of those three languages, looking or listening to the other two must be strange. Not only are these languages vastly different in their structure, but they also have vastly different writing systems with Khoisan languages not having a writing system at all!

For those who might not be familiar with what Khosian languages are, its the family of languages from Africa use [click consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant).

I believe it's safe to say that most people reading this have little to no experience in understanding the man in the above video. If this holds true for you, then you are in the phase of knowing nothing.


#### Math Equations

A second and much more popular subject with which most people know nothing is the vast field of mathematics. Of course most know at least up to algebra and maybe some calculus, but take a look at the following symbols:

Have any idea what it means? Even for those who might be "familiar" with the equation, it's unlikely that one really understands what the different symbols mean and how they work together.

So how does one get past the stage of knowing nothing? This stage is the simplest to move beyond, but is the hardest to start given that most have no motivation to do so. There is an incomprehensible amount which any given person does not know and it would be folly to try and know something about literally everything. People simply don't have that kind of time and resources so we must be selective about what we feed our brains.

So the first step, although it might be redundant for most, is to find a motivation to learn what ever it is that you are trying to understand. The reason I say that this is redundant is that most people who think about subjects they don't understand already have some motivation to understand them. By virtue of devoting more thoughts to something one has at least an interest in the topic.

So once motivation has been found, one must then proceed to grasping the general idea of the subject they want to understand. Google, Wikipedia, and youtube are great resources for simple exposure to topics.

### Memorization

Once you have an idea of what a subject is about, you enter the phase where you must memorize the basic building blocks of the topic. This might seem strange given the shifting emphasis in education away from memorization toward "intuitive" mental models, but there is a reason that Mr. Miagi made Daniel wash the cars and paint the fences. Just like riding a bike, there are certain mental and perhaps physical muscle movements that must be instinct before one can proceed with learning.

#### Learning Nouns

A good example of this is learning nouns as a child. Imagine for a minute that you had to explain to someone who knew nothing of English what the word "bird" meant. In this case, the best way to teach them is to simple show them images of birds and say "bird" as you point to it. At any language's lowest level there are words which simply cannot be defined in any other way.

Take for example the word "joke". According to Webster, it's definition is as follows:

*something said or done to provoke laughter; especially :  a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist*

For someone who knows nothing of English, adding more words does not help in the slightest. Try to explain any one of these words with it's definition is equally as futile. Laughter becomes *a sound of or as if of laughing*, then laughing *to show emotion (such as mirth, joy, or scorn) with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound*, then emotion *the affective aspect of consciousness*, etc. There is a reason that children's speech is much simpler than our own. While I don't have personal experience with the matter, I believe that parents can attest to the fact that babies begin talking by learning to associate words with certain objects or actions. "Mama" and "Dada" are common first words which should come as a shock to no one. I highly doubt that any infant learned the meaning of "mama" through it's definition in Webster. It is only after learn several of these basic associations that children begin to notice patterns and actually *create* more complex utterances.
