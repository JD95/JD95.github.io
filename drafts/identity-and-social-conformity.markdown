By the strangest train of thought I found myself awakening from a dream, so real that it fooled me into believing that I was in such a state of mind at my own choosing. As with all lies, the ones we believe to be true are the hardest to shake. Only with a certain reluctance are we able to let go of our sense of orientation and grounding in reality so as to transfer into a new pattern of disillusionment.

Confusing as such matters are, I ensure you that I'm not rambling for the sake of sounding intellectual and overly philosophical. Recently I have taken the position that any type of philosophical thought is rather pointless without a clear goal in mind. What dream did I wake from? Why, the dream of every day life.

Most of our decisions are made for us by reflexes. We rarely choose to breath or swallow, such things are regulated unconciously. What else, I pondered as I sat on that abstract bench, was regulated by our unconciouss? I'd argue a fair bit more than most give creedence to.

For example, what are you, the reader, wearing at the moment and why? For what particular reason does anyone choose to wear a specific color of shirt or a certain pair of shoes? Of course there are occassions in which someone may give more thought to the choice as opposed to simply needing garmants to go about the day wearing. But alas, this leads to yet more questions!

Why wear clothes at all? Why go to work or pick up the kids from school? Why not do anything else? Such questions lead to the deepest of philosophical questions, of which I will not be addressing. Instead I'll be giving my thoughts on a very particular and personal case.

![Musical Iceberg Meme](../images/music-iceberg.jpg)

This is a meme which was popular recently. The format is simple, at the top level of the iceberg are the normal subgenres of some topic, in this case music. As we descend deeper into the depths, the subjects grow more outlandish until we reach the bottom where those who partake are dubbed "disattached from the social dogma". For music this lowest level contains composers who write the most difficult to listen to music, some wouldn't even go so far as to call these works "music".

When I first stumbled across this particular instance of the meme, my immediate reaction was to start listening to the composers at the lowest level. Why though? Upon reflect I know there was indeed a time in my life where I would only have listened to the music at level 1. It goes without saying that I now have an appreciation for the most outlandish music, but this feature is not witohut its parallels in my other fields of study.

An example that most of my friends tease me about is my obsession with the programming language Haskell which, to many of my peers, is a strange language on the fringes of popular conversation. Why did I learn Haskell in the first place? I could make excuses like "I wanted to learn a functional language before my programming languages class", but in all honesty I wanted to learn it because it was weird and different from what everyone else was using.

Does this make me a hipster? Let's check urban dictionary for an amusing definition

> Hipster's can't be defined because then they'd fit in a category, and thus be too mainstream.

Has everyone been in this category at some point in their lives? Am I the only person who wants to do something different from everyone else for the mere sake of being different? Being different would make me feel special, important even. Strange, why is being different inherently better though? In terms of medicine I doubt many would choose "alternative" treatments for ailments which have essentially been "solved" by modern science. Why should we choose to diverge from what works in other reguards?

What then when entire subcultures exist on the basis of being "different"? 

## Identity and Uniqueness

## That which resists categorization

How do we classify something that is aware of what we are doing, and evolving to no longer fit a particular category?

## The spectrums and beyond

Our cultures are filled with spectrums and dicotomies

Progressive and Conservative

Poor and Rich

Tech savy and Tech illiterate

Lets imagine someone who is at school.
There are two main groups of kids: wild and dirty kids who run around all recess, and clean quite kids who sit on benches and read books all break. Imagine you arrive at this new school and are forced to choose between the two groups for friends to play with. Let's say that you choose the wild kids because they look like more fun. For a time your feel like you picked wisely, the kids are sparatic, carefree, and excentric. Yet, over time, you begin to realize that the kids keep changing games, not out of boredom, but because everyone wanted to win. You notice that there really is no play going on at all, but the entire group is merely swarming in an attempt for validation and attention.

At last, you grow tired of the antics and leave to join the quiet kids, realizing that without an actual game, there is no fulfillment to be had with the wild kids. Looking to one of the book readers you notice that they, without having spoken at all had already made a place for you. A smile crosses your face as you pick up a book and begin to read. Over the next few days you pass the wild children running about with your nose in the air, confident that you were spending your recess in a much more fulfilling way than they.

Weeks go by, and the once confident smile begins to falter. The books, while interesting at first, have lost your interest and at last your realize you have spent the last few lunches merely sitting and looking blankly at the same sentence. You begin to wonder if everyone else on the benches was doing the same, and if so, why were they wasting such beautiful weather? Then it dawns upon you that these kids were just as bad as the wild kids, but in a different respect. The book readers read for the sole purpose of not being a wild kid. They read for the sake of being different, better. Perhaps there is something to be said about reading being good for you, but youth demands more action, more play.

A silly little scenario, but it illustrates my point in a way that I believe everyone can relate to. Generally, most social spectrums can be interperated as being choices between carelessness and restraint.

In a way, this playground story mirrors the tale of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. He left behind the palace and city to seek the solution to suffering and came upon the ascetics who denied themselves all pleasures in life. For a time the buddha followed such practices but eventually forsake them after nearly collapsing from malnurishment. He went on to reach enlightenment under a pipal tree and discovered a middle path, away from both extremes.

Aristotle also perscribed a course of moderation, citing that extreme over indulgence or deficenies were harmful.

Is moderation the answer then? Perhaps, ideology at both extremes of any trait seem to be dangerous, yet the question of identity hovers over us. If we forsake our ability to go further than others in any respect to avoid the blindness the edges cause us, then by what means can we differentiate ourselves?

We are trapped, like the flatlanders in the 2D plane, unable to reach out in the larger 3D world.

## Purpose

Think back to the scenario of the playground. Initially one makes the choice based on who is having more fun, right? Upon realizing that one group cannot satisfy our goal we turned to the other group who equally failed to give us what we wanted. It is easy to dismiss the importance of the fact that a choice was made in both cases. Initially the wild kids appear to be living out youthful joy to the max through games and lots of physicall activity. The bench kids seemed to be spending their time on a much more valuable and rewarding endeavour which did not defeat it's own purpose. Are either of these inherently bad? I don't think so. The problems occur in the actual implementation of either ideal.

The wild kids weren't playing for fun, they were playing to win, for attention. The book kids weren't reading to learn, they were reading to feel superior to everyone else. As I said in the begining, any philosphical idea is pointless without some kind of pre-existing goal. These kinds of decisions are no different.

Practicallity would simply state that when one has energy they should play out on the grass and when one gets tired of the antics to join the kids on the bench. This isn't really moderation in the sense of finding a single activity which falls in between either camp, but instead represents a shifting of the underling goal, namely to have fun. Once a purpose is chosen, decisions can then be made on the basis of furthering that agenda.

If one wants to be popular, act as the popular kids do. There is nothing wrong with being popular, everyone needs some kind of socialization. If one wants to be smart, then act like smart people do. So long as there is a goal in mind, then you aren't acting on impulse. If we can awknowledge that there are certain primative instincts which guide our inital decisions and we also admit that our motivations can evolve over time, then there is nothing wrong with a "come for the mummy, stay for the art" attitude.
