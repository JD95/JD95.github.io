title: On Motivation and Simply Doing the Thing
---

# Intro

Ever catch yourself thinking back on your past and fantasize about different choices you could have made to improve your current situation? Could you have studied harder? Started working out? Told that one person how you actually felt?

> "Why didn't you?"

Often the excuses encompass some amount of youthful stupidity or a certain amount of "not knowing any better". You know better now though, right? If you were to think forward in time, imagining youself looking back to this very moment, what would you critcize yourself for not doing? And now the real question:

> "Why are you not simply doing the thing?"

The excuses now become far more intricate. In my own experience with weight lifting I know one of my primary excuses for not going to the gym consistently was not being able to give it my all that day. "What's the point", I would think you myself, "if I'm not getting an optimal workout?". Of course this kind of thinking would lead to long stretches of time where I was simply not "ready" to go lift.

A fairly lame excuse. In fact, pathetic even. If ever there were a quote to summarize this behavior:

> "Everyone wants to be a bodybuilder, but don't nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weights."

I could go on a long rant about how people these days expect instant gratification and never want to put in the work for their results, but that horse has been beaten to death too many times for me to get any satisfaction in bludgening it further. Instead I'll ressurect a different meme:

> "Yesterday, you said tomorrow, so JUST DO IT!!!!111!11one"

I've done this more times than I can count or remember. After setting myself up late at night for untold success and productivity the next day, I wake up to find that my spark has snuffed itself out in the hours of sleep from then to now and the magnetic pull of my normal routinee tugs me back into the same cycle of dissapointment. Such tedious monotony! Surely anyone aware of such a pitiful perdicament would try at their utmost to escape, yet most don't. I didn't, and at times I feel like I'm making no progress out of the ditch and instead watch the boulder roll all the way back to the bottom. Where is my smile then?

# Spectrum of Motivation and Capability

In my experience, whether or not one is able to make significant progress towards their goals is often determined by two factors: motivation and capability. Motivation corresponds to the emotional drive to accomplish a task. Capability is tied to the physical, and perhaps mental obstacles which stand in one's way. A very simplified model of one's life I admit, but inception relies on simple and easy to digest ideas.

## Happy

In this model, happiness can be described as the state of being completely motivated and completely capable. There are no mental demons or physical ailments in the way of progress and progress comes easy.

## Lazy / Comfortable

When one lacks motivation, but has full capabilities, one is called lazy. Often, lazy people are blamed for wasting their potential.

## Injured

Highly motivated people are not always successful. Sometimes there are barriers which prevent progress. Whether it be injury or mental trauma, something blocks maximum progress, if not all progress entirely.

## Depressed

Rock bottom. Nihilist. Nothing matters. No progress possible, and I don't even care. That endless black hole which comsumes all light, never once minding the darkness as something to escape. No motivation, no capability, only existing in silent agony from moment to moment.

Grim, but some people are caught in this state.

# Cognitive Intertia

Although these states seem fairly relatable, I doubt anyone is truly in any one of these except on the rarest occasions. More than likely, day to day life puts us in various orbits closer towards the center.

Where is the orbit that I described earlier? Thinking back, I believe that I was fully capable of lifting, even though I didn't feel like it and made excuses. I'd categorize this as me being lazy, yet I found moments of motivation.

The question here is why a single motvational speech didn't push me into being completely motivated. Most of us have been given a pep talk or been given reasons why we should persue some goal. I don't doubt that, moments after, people actually feel motivated to take action. The problem lies in the lack of immediate action on that motivation. Maybe they went home and made a planner, plotting out their future progress, filled up a todo list, and set themselves up for success. Then they go to sleep and wake up, walking past all of these things as they continue doing the same thing they always have.

Sometime later, they'll hear another motivational speech and repeat the processes, until motivational speechs no longer ignite the firey power of youth. No more do words of encouragement inspire, and no more do images of those who are successful prompt a positive response. Maybe one might even begin to resent those who are successful, working the idea into their heads that these "sucess stories" must be frauds or that their once idols must actually be very miserable.

The power of the human mind to rationalize its situation is staggering. I'll call the phenomena of not acting on motivation a symptom of cognitive interia, although I admit I don't have the research to back up such a claim. Perhaps I should call it something else and I will likely revise this post to correct the term later, I just wanted to publish something.

Anyways, why is cognitive intertia so powerful? Inertia in the realm of physics is a property of matter to maintain it's velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The larger the mass of an object, the larger the inertia, and thus the force required to change momentum. The longer one has been alive, in the same routinee, the more engrained such behavior becomes in the mind. It's more than just a bad habit, it becomes a life style.

Like culture, such deeply engrained ideas do not come out easily. Cultures do not change immediately without great, and usually terrible events. Most changes occur slowly and overtime. It's taken me several years to even start going to the gym consistently, I believe because I never had too much motivation to actually get in shape. I rationalized my acceptance of being really skinny by compensating with my "intellect". An arrogant position, but high schoolers often are. After accepting that I know nothing about most things and very little about the things I've studied, I lost my ability to rationalize away my concerns about my body.

The real kicker was getting into college and seeing people who were both smarter than me and in better shape. Even with the direct proof infront of my eyes that I could improve I still made excuse after excuse. On some days it still takes mental effort to walk into the gym, even though I always feel great when I leave. Thus is the power of cognitive inertia and living a certain way for twenty one years.

# Conclusion

What's my solution then? This must be the reason I've written so much to introduce the problem. I must have a grand solution which will fix all of your problems and finally enable you to achieve your dreams! Well, not really...

One cannot just do it because most don't have the life style to support the work needed.

I myself still struggle with my own lack of motivation and I don't believe I'm a model anyone should look up to, but I'll share my thoughts on the matter in hopes that it sparks your own ideas.

The best motivator to break out of the cycle is actually instant gratification. Little victories which are easy to achieve are water droplets, flowing down a mountain. Having trouble running long distances? Don't think in terms of running a mile, instead put your effort into going just one more step than last time. Have a phobia of going to the gym? Just walk into the gym and walk around for a bit. If you can't draw, make a scribble. Can't compose? Mash notes. Although it took millions of years, the grand canyon was formed by a river.

Do the easy things until they become habits, but keep that end goal in mind. Come back to your full dream and evaluate your current habits. By doing the easy steps which get you instant gratification, you'll have made very little progress, essentially you'll be exactly where you were before, except you won't be. You might not be writing novels, but a paragraph a day isn't nothing. Maybe now you're ready for two paragraphs? Maybe you can run on the treadmill a bit?

The most important aspect of this mentality is not as a trick to make progress on any specific item, but as a philosophy it can start to infect everything else you do. Why let any aspect of your life stagnate? Many cultures around the world view stagnation as a form, or cause of, impurity, and for good reason. Hating yourself for doing little, instead of nothing, is a massive shift in perspective. Just keep adding pebbles and one day you'll realize you're at the top of a mountain.

In order to simply do the thing, just do the simple things and then do a bit more.
