<p>Even though I’m a computer science major who thinks nothing but the best of new technology, there is some part of me that wishes my handwriting was better. Recently I read “How to Read a Book” by Mortimer Adler, and concluded that I should revisit the areas of grammar and logic to improve my reading. While it is fun to bash the current educational system, it would be foolish to completely dismiss old practices solely on the basis that they are old. Given that I still take notes by hand, although on a tablet instead of paper most of the time, my hand writing is thus important for my future self and anyone with whom I would share my notes.</p>
<p>Here is a benchmark as to where my handwriting is at the moment:</p>

<p>With my right hand I seem to have an odd mix of print and some sloppy form of cursive. While probably legible I want to have consistency and I think the best way to do that is to master cusrive writing. The reason I include my left hand is that I have always wanted to be ambi-dexterous and this provides an execellent way to train something without being able to use any experience.</p>

<p>I’ve gathered several cursive practice sheets from the internet and set them as background images in this OneNote page. Using my stylus I’ll trace over these practice sheets every day with both hands and record hand writing samples every week until I’m satisfied that I’ve achieved acceptable cursive writing with both hands.</p>
