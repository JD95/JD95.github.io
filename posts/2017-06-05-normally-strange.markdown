title: Normally Strange

> A bit of a rambling post, forgive me, but I've been sitting on this for too long and it needed to go.

By the strangest train of thought I found myself awakening from a dream, so real that it fooled me into believing that I was in such a state of mind at my own choosing. As with all lies, the ones we believe to be true are the hardest to shake. Only with a certain reluctance are we able to let go of our sense of orientation and grounding in reality so as to transfer into a new pattern of disillusionment.

Confusing as such matters are, I ensure you that I'm not rambling for the sake of sounding intellectual and overly philosophical. Recently I have taken the position that any type of philosophical thought is rather pointless without a clear goal in mind. What dream did I wake from? Why, the dream of every day life.

Most of our decisions are made for us by reflexes. We rarely choose to breath or swallow, such things are regulated unconciously. What else, I pondered as I sat on that abstract bench, was regulated by our unconciouss? I'd argue a fair bit more than most give creedence to.

For example, what are you, the reader, wearing at the moment and why? For what particular reason does anyone choose to wear a specific color of shirt or a certain pair of shoes? Of course there are occassions in which someone may give more thought to the choice as opposed to simply needing garmants to go about the day wearing. But alas, this leads to yet more questions!

Why wear clothes at all? Why go to work or pick up the kids from school? Why not do anything else? Such questions lead to the deepest of philosophical questions, of which I will not be addressing. Instead I'll be giving my thoughts on a very particular and personal case.

![Musical Iceberg Meme](../images/music-iceberg.jpg)

This is a meme which was popular at one point. The format is simple, at the top level of the iceberg are the normal subgenres of some topic, in this case music. As we descend deeper into the depths, the subjects grow more outlandish until we reach the bottom where those who partake are dubbed "disattached from the social dogma". For classical music this lowest level contains composers who write the most difficult to listen to music, some wouldn't even go so far as to call these works "music".

When I first stumbled across this particular instance of the meme, my immediate reaction was to start listening to the composers at the lowest level. Why though? Upon reflect I know there was indeed a time in my life where I would only have listened to the music at level 1. It goes without saying that I now have an appreciation for the most outlandish music, but this feature is not without its parallels in my other fields of study.

I like strange programming languages, like watching movies which are particularly awful, and even study weird branches of math for the lulz. Is there a rhyme or a reason to lean towards obscure and unpopular subjects? Most associate these tendencies with hipsters.

Does this make me a hipster? Let's check urban dictionary for an amusing definition:

> Hipster's can't be defined because then they'd fit in a category, and thus be too mainstream.

Has everyone been in this category at some point in their lives? Am I the only person who wants to do something different from everyone else for the mere sake of being different? Being different would make me feel special, important even. Strange, why is being different inherently better though? In terms of medicine I doubt many would choose "alternative" treatments for ailments which have essentially been "solved" by modern science. Why should we choose to diverge from what works in other reguards?

Silly questions, why do we even itch to be normal or different in the first place? WHY?

Taken to either extreme, the tendency breaks down. What then when entire subcultures exist on the basis of being "different"? What happens when governments try to suppress individuality? Does being different then mean being normal? Are we trapped by the old addage?

> "And when everyone is super... no one will be."

People rebel and scorn others to conform. People seekout the weird and obscure for it's own sake and reject them for similar reasons. Have you ever had a favorite song that everyone else thought was bad? A favorite shirt that no one liked or a uniform you hated. Ever put a tag over a logo or pay hundreds just to have one? Are these really our choices?

Do we really *want* any of these things or are we propelled by some inner drive towards them? When we feel too crushed by social norms we differentiate. When too many people become different, that becomes the new norm. So what do we do? Can't be normal, can't be different. Perhaps we are asking the wrong question. In the end, what does it matter so long as we get some kind of fulfillment out of it? So long as one can understand music in their own way, then listening to it is no more different than listening to something "normal". Perhaps we shouldn't learn to live either in a state of conformity or defiance, but rather in a trajectory towards the interesting and exciting. 

The real battle is against boredom and for understanding. No one wants to stagnate, yet we want to be comfortable. Everyone wants to hear new music, see new art, but want to be able to understand it just as well. Perhaps we need those dissattached from the social dogma, the pioneers and arguable madmen, to find new an interesting takes on life so that the rest of us might benifit from when the discoveries finally find a form the laggards can understand. And if we can understand this, we might be less dismissive of the strange, unfamiliar and value the contributions that those on the fringes make to keeping our lives interesting.

Although, is it really *us* that wants life to be interesting...or is it...
