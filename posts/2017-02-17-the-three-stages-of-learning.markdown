title: The Three Stages of Learning
---

I try to write these posts with sources to back up my claims, but I found it rather difficult to find any literature on this subject, at least in the way that I constructed the idea in my mind. Today I'm going to flesh out some ideas on the learning process which will be further explored in later posts along with, hopefully, more research which supports the general model.

Recently, I have become increasingly interested in the learning process and ways to learn "correctly". Without much prior research to go off of, that I am currently aware of, I conjecture that there are distinct "phases" in learning any new topic. I say topic, because there is a distinction to be made between learning something abstract like linear algebra and learning something mechanical like tying one's shoes. Opening a door or brushing one's teeth is something that does not require years of struggling with complex research papers, instead those types of tasks can be "learned" by imitation most times. However interesting these "simple" learning objectives are, they are not what I am going to focus on in this section. That being said, those types of tasks will appear again.

### Stages of Competence

Some like to model the process of learning as stages of competence, whereby progress is measured by a self awareness of one's competence in a certain area.

1. Unconscious Incompetence "You don't know what you don't know"
2. Conscious Incompetence "You know what you don't know"
3. Conscious Competence "You can do it, but you have to think"
4. Unconscious Competence "You can do it in your sleep"

This stages are symmetrical, marking the rise and fall of skill from an unconscious state of inability to an unconscious state of mastery. The model makes sense in that most masters of a skill appear to perform with such grace and ease that unskilled observers might be tricked into believing the task is actually that simple. Of course, anyone who has tried to perform a magic trick knows there is a great deal more subtlety than is outwardly apparent.

However, the stages of competence provides no real direction or guidance as to *how* one moves from one stage to the next. Most would simply put forth the typical "10,000 hours of practice" as the prescription and leave students to their own devices. It seems that, beyond a certain point, students of any discipline have the inherent responsibility to teach themselves in varying degrees. As one progresses toward higher education, the direction becomes loose and an emphasis on conversation over lecture becomes more prominent. Why though?

Do graduate teachers lack something that elementary teachers have? Is there some implicit reason they cannot gain the same education results by simply *telling* the information to the would be learners? I would think so.

As I mentioned before, many tasks which are "simple enough" can be learned through imitation. In such cases it might even be enough to just talk at someone until the pieces click and they have learned. When subjects like math or the arts reach a certain point, there is a level of self discovery necessary for progress to be made at all. Some elements of understand cannot be simply conveyed through instruction and students must build their own mental models. With this in mind I will now outline what I believe stands as a kind of "universal" journey anyone learning anything abstract must go through.

First, one must be made aware of how little they know about a subject. It must become apparent that learning is required and familiarity gained. I'll call this phase "Knowing Nothing". It closely mirrors the stages of Unconscious Incompetence and Conscious Competence.

Second, one must learn, often by route, the fundamentals of a topic. This is the phase where memorization of the "axioms" of a topic occurs. Basic facts and motor skills *must* be learned in order to progress.

Finally, one must see the higher patterns within the mass of information one accumulates in the second phase. Here notes become symphonies, numbers become algebras, and ingredients become meals.

### Knowing Nothing

At this stage one knows next to nothing about a subject beyond what it is called or maybe even a vague familiarity gleaned through TV, books, or the Internet. Children experience this state much more than adults or even teenagers do. As people grow older they likely have much more lite exposure to unfamiliar concepts and grow to "accept" the feeling as a part of life.

#### Foreign Languages

For example it is unlikely for someone to know English, Chinese, and a Khoisan language at the same time. For someone who knows only one of those three languages, looking or listening to the other two must be strange. Not only are these languages vastly different in their structure, but they also have vastly different writing systems with Khoisan languages not having a writing system at all!

For those who might not be familiar with what Khosian languages are, its the family of languages from Africa use [click consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant).

I believe it's safe to say that most people reading this have little to no experience in understanding the man in the above video. If this holds true for you, then you are in the phase of knowing nothing.


#### Math Equations

A second and much more popular subject with which most people know nothing is the vast field of mathematics. Of course most know at least up to algebra and maybe some calculus, but take a look at the following symbols:

Have any idea what it means? Even for those who might be "familiar" with the equation, it's unlikely that one really understands what the different symbols mean and how they work together.

So how does one get past the stage of knowing nothing? This stage is the simplest to move beyond, but is the hardest to start given that most have no motivation to do so. There is an incomprehensible amount which any given person does not know and it would be folly to try and know something about literally everything. People simply don't have that kind of time and resources so we must be selective about what we feed our brains.

So the first step, although it might be redundant for most, is to find a motivation to learn what ever it is that you are trying to understand. The reason I say that this is redundant is that most people who think about subjects they don't understand already have some motivation to understand them. By virtue of devoting more thoughts to something one has at least an interest in the topic.

So once motivation has been found, one must then proceed to grasping the general idea of the subject they want to understand. Google, Wikipedia, and youtube are great resources for simple exposure to topics.

### Memorization

Once you have an idea of what a subject is about, you enter the phase where you must memorize the basic building blocks of the topic. This might seem strange given the shifting emphasis in education away from memorization toward "intuitive" mental models, but there is a reason that Mr. Miagi made Daniel wash the cars and paint the fences. Just like riding a bike, there are certain mental and perhaps physical muscle movements that must be instinct before the rest of the subject can make sense.

#### Learning Nouns

A good example of this is learning nouns as a child. Imagine for a minute that you had to explain to someone who knew nothing of English what the word "bird" meant. In this case, the best way to teach them is to simple show them images of birds and say "bird" as you point to it. At any language's lowest level there are words which simply cannot be defined in any other way.

Take for example the word "joke". According to Webster, it's definition is as follows:

*something said or done to provoke laughter; especially :  a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist*

For someone who knows nothing of English, adding more words does not help in the slightest. Try to explain any one of these words with it's definition is equally as futile. Laughter becomes *a sound of or as if of laughing*, then laughing *to show emotion (such as mirth, joy, or scorn) with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound*, then emotion *the affective aspect of consciousness*, etc. There is a reason that children's speech is much simpler than our own. While I don't have personal experience with the matter, I believe that parents can attest to the fact that babies begin talking by learning to associate words with certain objects or actions. "Mama" and "Dada" are common first words which should come as a shock to no one. I highly doubt that any infant learned the meaning of "mama" through it's definition in Webster. It is only after learn several of these basic associations that children begin to notice patterns and actually *create* more complex utterances.

### Knowing the Patterns

Patterns are everywhere. The human mind is hard wired to make associations and abstractions. It is this capacity which allows symphonies to become message of universal brotherhood, words to epics, and colors into paintings. Any composer, I hope, would tell you that music is more than *just* the notes. Even Bach's most absolute music encompassed ideals of symmetry and a sense of the divine. Mathematicians could tell novices that from simple concepts like numbers, an architecture for the universe can be derived. So then how does one get from point a to point b?

Every subject is different in this regard, but the sense of "arrival" can be similarly described. A simple measure is that of creativity and purpose behind the choices one makes. Anyone can put words onto a page with the intent of conveying an idea, as I am doing now, but a master picks the right words in the right order to convey a specific and significant idea, doing so with the vast amount of knowledge and experience gained from the second phase of learning.

This is why there typically exists an "Art of ..." book in almost any discipline. Masters have pieced together the raw knowledge into structure and humans are suckers for previously unforeseen structures and relationships.

So my advice for moving into the stage of knowing the patterns of a subject is to simply try creating something using the knowledge you would have accumulated by now. This is the point where the 10,000 hours of practice comes into play because there is no one that can simply "implant" such connections into your mind.
