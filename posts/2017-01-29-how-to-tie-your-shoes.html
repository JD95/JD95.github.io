<p>Learning to tie one’s shoes is generally one of the earliest accomplishments of note for kids. Not only is it nice to not have to ask for help when putting on shoes, it also allows one to take another step towards being a “big kid”. This will problably be the first of a series of blog posts on the various milestones in life, at least until adulthood. Anyways, in my grand quest to learn about learning lets ask the question of whether or not most people learn how to tie their shoes <em>correctly</em>. What does it mean to be correct in the sense of tying shoes? Let’s first examine the purpose of doing it at all.</p>
<p>Naturally, shoes with laces must be tied to prevent one from tripping on the laces as the go about their day. Most people learn one of two methods: the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/standardknot.htm">Standard Shoelace Knot</a> or the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/twoloopknot.htm">Two Loop “bunny ears” Knot</a>. While both of these methods satisfy the first condition, preventing one from tripping, they also introduce new problems. Using the two common knots leads to one having to tie their shoes multiple times throughout the day. Then, at the end of the day, they have to go through the trouble of untying their laces. Common “fixes” to these issues include doing the “double knot” which is effectively knotting the laces twice. This isn’t an ideal solution because it not only increases the effort needed to untie the laces, it also does not completely solve the problem of the laces coming undone in the first place.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to tie more knots to increase security, the best approach is to simply use a different kind of knot which is more secure by construction. Yet sometimes there is also the issue of needing to tie one’s shoes quickly as opposed to needing a secure knot. To both of these ends I supply the following:</p>

<p>While I don’t have any links to the proofs of this, it has been claimed that the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm">Ian Knot</a> is mathematically the fastest way to tie shoelaces. Although this method is tricky to pick up, I’ve found that it beats the two common methods every time in terms of speed.</p>

<p>This is the method that I typically use to tie my shoes. Mr. Fieggen (aka. “Professor Shoelace”) gave a great description of how well this knot works <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknottech.hmt">here</a>. I can attest to his claims that this knot <em>never</em> comes undone during the day as well as the ease of untying the knot at the end of the day. Although not as fast as the speed knot, it is an actual solution to the problem of loose shoelaces.</p>
